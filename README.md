## Project Description
The goal of the project is to develop an AI-powered system that analyzes images of plant
leaves, detects diseases, and provides actionable recommendations for treatment. The project
combines Computer Vision for image analysis and Machine Learning / NLP for recommendation
generation.

Plant diseases are a major cause of crop loss worldwide. Early detection and timely inter-
vention can significantly reduce agricultural losses and increase crop yield. This tool can help
farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers monitor plant health efficiently, even without
expert knowledge.
