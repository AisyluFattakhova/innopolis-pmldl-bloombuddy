## Project Idea
The goal of the project is to develop an AI-powered system that analyzes images of plant
leaves, detects diseases, and provides actionable recommendations for treatment. The project
combines Computer Vision for image analysis and  NLP for recommendation
generation.  Plant diseases are a major cause of crop loss worldwide. Early detection and timely inter-
vention can significantly reduce agricultural losses and increase crop yield. This tool can help
farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers monitor plant health efficiently, even without
expert knowledge. To run the Application you can download BloomBuddy.exe from the latest Release.
