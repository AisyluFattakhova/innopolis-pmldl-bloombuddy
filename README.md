## 💡 Project Idea
The goal of the project is to develop an AI-powered system that analyzes images of plant
leaves, detects diseases, and provides actionable recommendations for treatment. The project
combines Computer Vision for image analysis and Machine Learning / NLP for recommendation
generation.

Plant diseases are a major cause of crop loss worldwide. Early detection and timely inter-
vention can significantly reduce agricultural losses and increase crop yield. This tool can help
farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers monitor plant health efficiently, even without
expert knowledge.

## 🌱 Features

-  **Upload Leaf Images** – Easily upload images of plant leaves to get instant analysis.  
-  **Automatic Disease Classification** – Detect whether the leaf is healthy or affected by a disease.    
-  **Actionable Recommendations** – Provides treatment and care suggestions for detected diseases, powered by NLP knowledge base.  
-  **User-Friendly Interface** – Intuitive web interface that allows quick interaction even without prior expertise.  
-  **Visual Explanations** – Optionally highlight affected areas on leaves to understand the model's decisions.  

##   Roadmap

###  Stage 0: Datasets
- Collect and organize datasets  
- Perform preprocessing (resizing, normalization, cleaning)  
- Explore datasets and visualize examples  
- Split data into training, validation, and testing sets  

###  Stage 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
- Basic image classification of healthy vs. diseased leaves  
- Web interface to upload leaf images  
- Display predicted disease   

###  Stage 2: Model & Analysis Enhancements
- Experiment with different CV and DL architectures  
- Compare training strategies (from scratch vs. transfer learning)  
- Apply data augmentation techniques to improve generalization  
- Evaluate results with appropriate metrics and visualizations  

###  Stage 3: NLP & Recommendations
- Provide actionable treatment or care recommendations based on predictions  
- Implement a simple assistant (chat/FAQ) to answer user questions  

###  Stage 4: Deployment & Usability
- Enable batch image upload and processing  
- Export results/reports in CSV or Excel format  
- Optimize the model for faster inference and lighter deployment  
- Explore deployment on mobile or embedded devices
